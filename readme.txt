This project was a quick experiment into seeing the feasibillity of making an ecommerce site using cakephp

To install, extract and setup cakephp version 3.0.4 (latest version I tested on) and extract the files to that folder. You will then need to setup the database and run the sql file in the /scripts folder. The cakephp database must be correct.

The path is the sever address /stores

This site uses skeleton for responsive design. skeleton.css and normalize.css needs to be extracted in /webroot/css Tested on version 2.0.4
